%% STEP 1: CALCULATE LARGEST SPHERE CENTERED IN EACH VOXEL
% We use the matlab built-in function bwdist to calculate the distance transform (euclidean)
% bwdist(BW) : For each pixel in BW, the distance transform assigns a number that is the distance between that pixel and the nearest nonzero pixel of BW
% then, bwdist(~BW,'euclidean') :
[dmap, IDX] = bwdist(~BW,'euclidean');

%% STEP 2: ASSIGN VOXELS TO THE LARGEST SPHERE THAT CONTAINS THEM
% Definition of the continum spherical PSD

% sphere" from largest sphere to smallest sphere and (ii) remove from
% further condition check all voxels which have been already assigned

        current_distance_map( abs(dmap-current_distance)<tolerance ) = 1;      % Voxels which are the center of the largest sphere are set equal to 1
        current_distance_map = bwdist(current_distance_map,'euclidean');

        Particle_size ( cond1 & Particle_size<(current_distance+tolerance) ) = current_distance;

        % Update distance transform
        if approximate % Faster but that will create some artifact near interfaces.
            dmapmod( cond1 & Particle_size<(current_distance+tolerance) )=-1;
        else
