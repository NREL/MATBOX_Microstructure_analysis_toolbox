Release version notes:

Note: characterization module major re-work is still on-going, but still need more time before being released.

Stochastic generation algorithm minor fix
- Add a warning in the GUI for the user not to resize figure otherwise video creation will fail. If user does, there is now also a catch error to notify the user the reason of the error
- More than 7 phases can be now generated (was simply limited by 'colororder' having 7 rows by default)
- Some tooltips addition in the GUI

Bug fix (generation module/stochastic algorithm): generated volumes with phases with low or zero volume fractions locally should now match the target volume fractions.

01/07/2022
Generation module, additive submodule: added third generation choice: coating
Updated author's list (welcome to Dr. Jerome Laurencin from CEA Grenoble, France)
Added instructions to change Iso2mesh temp folder to avoid right permission issue.

10/21/2021
All app files updated to MATLAB 2021b. If you have truncated interfaces, you should update to 2021b.
Stochastic particle generation algorithm documentation has been updated.

08/22/2021
Rework of the stochastic generation algorithm GUI
- Transition to App designer.
- Added stop conditions (generation rate and time limit).
- Added algorithm progression plot.
Documention is not yet updated, that would be for a next commit, however the GUI is more user-friendly now with additional explanations.
The generation algorithm itslef has not beed changed.

•	v1.0b (04/19/2021)
Updated author list. Version of softwareX journal article publication.

•	v1.0a (04/19/2021)
Updated author list
Generation module
- Fixed particle orientation visualization in the GUI

•	v1.0 (04/18/2021)
Generation module
- submodule deterministic generation is no more selectable from the GUI. But you can still call it from app designer. Once fleshed out, it will be re-introduced in the GUI.
- Microstructure genereation: dx and dz diameter were wrongly labelled. I think i got it right this time.
Characterization module
- Fix bug for RVE case D and E
Miscellaneous
- Import image file is now both *.tif and *.tiff

•	v0.91 (03/18/2021)
Generation module
- Added additive phase generation algorithm from Dr. Aashutosh N. Mistry, with documentation updated.
- Re-worked microstructure generation module (additive phase) GUI.
- Add new submodule: deterministic generation (incomplete).
- bug fixed: phase generation module dx, dy, dz diameters were assigned to wrong diameters.
- Volume fraction actualization fixed
Meshing module
- Mesh a unique microstructure, an half-cell, a full-cell (including the two current collectors, the two electrodes and the separator), or a polycrhistalline architecture.
- Add regular mesh generation option.
- GUI overhaul. Switched from programmatic GUI to MATLAB app design GUI.
Characterization module
- Connectivity calculation now also determine directional and oriented connectivity instead of only considering the largest cluster.
Visualization module
- Added checkerboard choice for comparison of segmented and grey level volumes.
- Switched from programmatic GUI to MATLAB app design GUI.
- Replace nanmax, nanmin with max, min to avoid need of Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in src\Microstrucrure_and_results_visualisation\microstructure_visualization_GUI.m
Filtering and segmentation module
- Added arguments for adapthisteq in the GUI, with updated documentation and examples.
Miscellaneous
- Updated main menu.
- New function: Microstructure_basic_visualization_interface.m and Microstructure_comparison_visualization_interface.m in src\Miscellaneous, used to avoid recoding visualization each time only simple 2D slice view is required.
Documentation
- Added analytical expression of the corrective factor used in specific surface area (§VII-5di).
- Added section XI USEFUL STANDALONE FUNCTIONS to present some functions that can be used independently for some very common task (such as loading a tif file, saving MATLAB tables in csv files, etc.).
- Added short introduction text for the ‘About the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’ section.
- Added references for the ‘Getting started with microstructure analysis’ section.

•	v0.9. First public release (06/29/2020)
