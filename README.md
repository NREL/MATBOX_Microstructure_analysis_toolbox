## What is MATBOX?
MATBOX is a MATLAB application for performing various microstructure-related tasks including **microstructure numerical generation**, **image filtering** and **microstructure segmentation**, **microstructure characterization**, **three-dimensional visualization**, **result correlation**, and **microstructure meshing**. \
MATBOX was originally developed to analyse electrode microstructures for lithium ion batteries; however, the algorithms provided by the toolbox are widely applicable to other heterogeneous materials.

## How to?
The toolbox provides a user-friendly experience thanks to a **Graphic-User Interface** and requires no coding to be used.
Installation and instructions are detailed in the documentation. Run src/Main_menu/Main_menu.mlapp to start the toolbox (mlapp extension corresponds to MATLAB app created with app designer) and choose the module relevant for your activity.

* MATBOX main menu and illustration of each module:

* The inputs for most modules are stack tiff files (which once imported in MATLAB are 3D arrays). MATBOX modules connectivity is illustrated below:

## How to contribute?
MATBOX already includes third-party open source algorithms (full list in documentation). If you wish to add algorithm(s) in MATBOX, please contact the author at francois.usseglioviretta@nrel.gov or let a message in the discussion section of this repository.
All the same if you have suggestions, feedbacks, or want to report a bug.

## Important notes
* I got some feedbacks from MAC users the GUI does not initialize well, while there is no issue for Windows Users. Therefore, currently Windows is recommended over other OS.
* Some modules built with app designer require MATLAB 2021a. A simple workaround is to open the mlapp file with app designer as it will automatically convert the file to your MATLAB version (but you may loss some functionnality).
* Matlab app designer does not have a consistent behavior from version to version about the GUI tab (left side of the interface). It may be truncated or not. If not truncated, it may truncate the right side of the GUI. If that happens to you, open the mlapp file with app designer and increase the width of the GUI (both the figure and the tab container). It should fix your issue.
