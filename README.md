# MATBOX: Microstructure Analysis Toolbox
**MATLAB open source microstructure analysis code embedded with a graphic user interface**\
*v2.0 beta preview February 2025*\

**Update: February 2025**\
I decided to release a preview version of MATBOX2.0 while I am finishing the rework of the characterization module.
The segmentation module is brand new with many new features. As well, the generation module offers new possibilities.
I will update the release notes only after I finish the rework, but for now, all modules except characterization can be used.
If you find bugs/issues, please open a ticket.


**Update: February 2024**\
Progress toward 2.0 public release (planned for early-mid 2024)
* **Microstructure generation module: done**\
  NEW: tube-based generation submodule (e.g. carbon nanotubes with curvature and non-overlapping)\
  NEW: web-based generation submodule (e.g. PTFE fibrils)\
  NEW: surface roughness generation submodule (stochastic or grains-based)\
  UPDATED: ellipsoids-based stochastic particle generation submodule: faster generation and masks

* **ROI, filtering and segmentation module: active development, near finished**\
  NEW: multiple files segmentation\
  NEW: create and use macros for automated segmentation\
  NEW: parallel segmentation workflows with workflow merging\
  NEW: local erosion and dilation\
  NEW: instance segmentation\
  UPDATED: revamped  GUI
  
* **Microstructure characterization: well advanced**\
  NEW: TPBL for fuel cell and electrolyzer\
  NEW: chord length particle size method\
  UPDATED: improved RVE calculations  
  UPDATED: more different type of connectivity  
  UPDATED: revamped  GUI
  
* **Microstructure visualization: done**\
  NEW: create video animation of your 3D microstructure\
  UPDATED: revamped visualization and better segmentation inspection

Some articles will be published concomitantly with the public release. Then I will work on revamping the documentation, starting with tutorial videos.

**Update: March 16 2023. There has not been an update for a while. The next version is still in development, just with more changes than initially expected.
If you are NREL and want to have access to the current version, please contact me (especially if you are doing characterization, as the new version of the module is much better than the one in the public repository).**

## What is MATBOX?
MATBOX is a MATLAB application for performing various microstructure-related tasks including **microstructure numerical generation**, **image filtering** and **microstructure segmentation**, **microstructure characterization**, **three-dimensional visualization**, **result correlation**, and **microstructure meshing**. \
MATBOX was originally developed to analyse electrode microstructures for lithium ion batteries; however, the algorithms provided by the toolbox are widely applicable to other heterogeneous materials.

## How to?
The toolbox provides a user-friendly experience thanks to a **Graphic-User Interface** and requires no coding to be used.
Installation and instructions are detailed in the documentation. Run src/Main_menu/Main_menu.mlapp to start the toolbox (mlapp extension corresponds to MATLAB app created with app designer) and choose the module relevant for your activity.

* MATBOX main menu and illustration of each module:

* The inputs for most modules are stack tiff files (which once imported in MATLAB are 3D arrays). MATBOX modules connectivity is illustrated below:

## How to contribute?
MATBOX already includes third-party open source algorithms (full list in documentation). If you wish to add algorithm(s) in MATBOX, please contact the author at francois.usseglioviretta@nrel.gov or let a message in the discussion section of this repository.
All the same if you have suggestions, feedbacks, or want to report a bug.

## Important notes
* I got some feedbacks from MAC users the GUI does not initialize well, while there is no issue for Windows Users. Therefore, currently Windows is recommended over other OS.
* Some modules built with app designer require MATLAB 2021a. A simple workaround is to open the mlapp file with app designer as it will automatically convert the file to your MATLAB version (but you may loss some functionnality).
* Matlab app designer does not have a consistent behavior from version to version about the GUI tab (left side of the interface). It may be truncated or not. If not truncated, it may truncate the right side of the GUI. If that happens to you, open the mlapp file with app designer and increase the width of the GUI (both the figure and the tab container). It should fix your issue.
